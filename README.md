Tittle : -Automatic Detection and Counting of RBCs Using Image Processing Technique 

Developed a full-stack web application to automate the detection and counting of red blood cells in microscopic images.Used Python and the Django framework to implement backend logic for image upload, processing, and result generation 
Applied OpenCV techniques such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and contour detection for accurate cell counting Designed and integrated a responsive front-end interface using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for better user experience 
Enabled faster and more reliable diagnostic support by reducing manual errors in blood cell analysis. Conducted testing with real sample images to validate the effectiveness of thealgorithm. Gained experience in full-stack development,
biomedical image processing, and healthcare-related software solutions
